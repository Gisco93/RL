\begin{question}{RL Exploration Strategies}{10}
	Discuss the two different exploration strategies applicable to RL.
	
\begin{answer}
The two different exploration strategies in Reinforcement Learning consist of \textit{exploitation}
and \textit{exploration}. To exploit means to make the best decision, given the current information wheras exploration is gathering more information. Given a set of actions in a given state, we can choose from, exploitation would mean to choose the best action suited to the state, thus the action resulting in the biggest reward. Exploration here, would mean to e.g. choose random, uniform on the actions to discover new information, through which maybe a better return can be obtained. To find the right trade-off between exploitation and exploration is a highly discussed and researched problem in RL. A in the lecture proposed algorithm, e. g. is the $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm. Following that policy, the most greedy action(hights immediate reward) will be performed with probabiltity $\epsilon$, otherwise an action will be choosen randomly. By that, we guarantee that both exploitation and exploration will be performed.
